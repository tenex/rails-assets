# /etc/init/sidekiq.conf - Sidekiq config
#
# From Mike Perham's GitHub
# https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/examples/upstart/sidekiq.conf
# See workers.conf for how to manage all Sidekiq instances at once.
#
# Save this config as /etc/init/sidekiq.conf then manage sidekiq with:
#   sudo start sidekiq index=0
#   sudo stop sidekiq index=0
#   sudo status sidekiq index=0
#
# Hack Upstart's reload command to 'quiet' Sidekiq:
#
#   sudo reload sidekiq index=0
#
# or use the service command:
#   sudo service sidekiq {start,stop,restart,status}
#

description "Rails-Assets Worker"

# This script is not meant to start on bootup, workers.conf
# will start all sidekiq instances explicitly when it starts.
#start on runlevel [2345]
#stop on runlevel [06]
